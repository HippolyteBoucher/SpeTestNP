* This is a new release.

## Changes after CRAN email for resubmission

* Changes to DESCRIPTION to add cited papers, Authors@R field

* Changes to CODE, DOCUMENTATION, and VIGNETTE, `T` into `TRUE` and `F` into `FALSE`, and `warning()` instead of `cat()`

* Changes to DOCUMENTATION, added VALUE field

* The package `AER` is unavailable on Linux and the application of the vignette of `SpeTestNP` uses `AER` thus `SpeTestNP` cannot be built on Linux. Maybe this can be bypassed.

* Changes to vignettes

* R CMD check results
